## **Project Summary: Compressed Qubit NOR Gate Simulator Inspired by AGC Architecture**

### **Overview**

This project presents a systems engineering approach to simulating classical NOR-based control logic using compressed quantum logic states. Inspired by the Apollo Guidance Computer’s NOR-only architecture, the model constrains qubit input states to minimize dimensional complexity while preserving logical expressiveness. The result is a hybrid framework that enables efficient quantum simulation of classical logic networks within tightly optimized qubit constraints. This work builds on the concept of constrained quantum logic simulation, drawing thematic parallels to Anand et al.'s (2022) exploration of classically simulatable quantum circuits. However, it focuses specifically on logic gate-level compression using NOR-only constraints inspired by historical AGC architecture.

### **Key Concepts**

* **AGC Logic Architecture**: The Apollo Guidance Computer used \~5600 3-input NOR gates to implement all digital logic (including AND, OR, XOR) — demonstrating the universality of NOR logic.

* **Quantum Compression via Input Constraints**:
  By constraining paired input qubits to only two valid states — (0,0) and (1,1) — we reduce the total input space from 6 independent bits (64 states) to just 3 effective bits (8 states). This enables NOR simulation using only **3 qubits**.

* **Dual NOR Logic with Symmetry**:
  Two 3-input NOR gates (Gate A and Gate B) receive identical inputs under the constraint $A_i = B_i$. This makes their outputs identical, allowing the system to focus on a **single NOR output** $Y_A$, further simplifying simulation.

### **Research Simulation Output Logic Table**

| A1,B1 | A2,B2 | A3,B3 | Y\_A (NOR) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| (0,0) | (0,0) | (0,0) | 1          |
| (0,0) | (0,0) | (1,1) | 0          |
| (0,0) | (1,1) | (0,0) | 0          |
| (0,0) | (1,1) | (1,1) | 0          |
| (1,1) | (0,0) | (0,0) | 0          |
| (1,1) | (0,0) | (1,1) | 0          |
| (1,1) | (1,1) | (0,0) | 0          |
| (1,1) | (1,1) | (1,1) | 0          |

This table illustrates the compressed logic state space using only 3 qubits. 
The NOR gate outputs 1 only when all three input bits are 0 — the only condition where classical NOR logic evaluates to true.

## Systems Engineering Approach

### 1. **Architectural Thinking**

I will need to take a legacy computing architecture (AGC’s NOR gate logic) and:

* Abstract its **logical structure**
* Apply **constraint-driven design**
* Reconstruct it in a quantum logic framework

**system-level design thinking**

---

### 2. **Dimensionality & Optimization**

My next approach:

* Reduce logical complexity (6 inputs → 3 qubits)
* Minimize state space (64 → 8)
* Use input symmetry and functional decomposition

This will need to be considered for classic **systems-level optimization**, not just quantum math. 
I hope I can design for **resource-efficiency**, which is **central to systems engineering**.

### 3. **Integration-Friendly Logic Compression**

* Anchor my method in a real-world control system which is the AGC Simulator
* Build a bridge to quantum computation via logic gate compression
* Target a hybrid, **implementable** system — not just academic proofs
